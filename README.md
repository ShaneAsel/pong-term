# Terminal Pong (Go)

This is a small **intro to Go** project I built to get familiar with the language — and to make a fun little terminal game for my son to play.

It's a basic implementation of **Pong**, playable entirely in the terminal using the arrow keys.

## 🎮 How to Play

- Use **↑** and **↓** to move your paddle (left side).
- The **CPU (right paddle)** tries to stop your shots.
- First to 3 points wins.
- After the game ends:
  - Press **Enter** to restart
  - Press **Esc** to quit
